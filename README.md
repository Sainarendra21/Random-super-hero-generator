# Generate Superhero Website

This is a simple website that allows users to generate a random superhero by clicking on the "Get New Hero" button. The website is built using HTML and JavaScript, and it utilizes a backend API to fetch random superhero images for display.

## Getting Started

To run the website locally, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git gh repo clone Sainarendra21/Random-super-hero-generator
cd Random-super-hero-generator
```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## How it Works

- When the user clicks the "Generate Superhero" button, a request is made to the backend API to fetch a random superhero image.
- The API returns a JSON response with the URL of the random superhero image and powers.
- The JavaScript code then updates the image displayed on the website with the fetched superhero image.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- JavaScript

## Backend API

The backend API used for generating random superhero images is provided by `[https://superheroapi.com/api.php/${SUPERHERO_TOKEN}`]`. This API returns a JSON response containing the URL of a random superhero image. The API is publicly accessible and does not require any authentication.

## Dependencies

The website has no external dependencies and should run smoothly on any modern web browser.
